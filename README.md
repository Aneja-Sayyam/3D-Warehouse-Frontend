This is a submission for my fabrik interview. This repository contains the frontend.

## Getting Started

First, install node_modules:

```bash
npm install
```

In case, you need to change the server url, copy .env.local.sample to .env.local and make the changes in that. env.local supersedes the other environment files.

Now, we build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

Finally, we can start the app.

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Cheers!!



> **_NOTE:_**  Please make sure you start the backend before accessing the frontend.
